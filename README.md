# omnis-infra
Infrastructure for any business application covering user access, configuration, logs and various other generic components to a business application.

Expects a companion Omnis library to work.

This is a super-companion library that forms the basis of all new projects at Platform Independent Systems Ltd.  It is a collection of generic business functions that are used in a wide variety of business solutions.

The key features include:

**users, roles and permissions** for complete control over what users can/cannot do through the user interface

**basic layout for a multi tenanted database** - this isnâ€™t to host thousands of businesses on one db, but to host a group of companies/subsidiaries within a site

**various logs**

**autosave**

**semaphores**

**feedback**

**async_emails** (sending emails to a db table to be picked up by external process)

**accounting periods**

**financial invoices**

**languages and countrie** with link file connecting many to many

**units of measure**

**configuration tables** (some visionary structure here, yet to be fully developed)

**import templates**
