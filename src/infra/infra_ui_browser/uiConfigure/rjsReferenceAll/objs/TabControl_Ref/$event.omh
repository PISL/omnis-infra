On evTabSelected
	;  This code has been written as though the subForm under the tab has been instantiated.
	;  The problem is that the first time through, when a form is instantiated for the first time... this code runs BEFORE the form has been instantiated.
	Calculate inCurrentTab as pTabNumber
	Do method $adjustToolsMenu     ;; No use first time around.  $init in subform takes up the slack.
