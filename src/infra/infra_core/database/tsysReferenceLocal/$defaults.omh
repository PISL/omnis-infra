Calculate $cinst.RFL_CLASS as pcClass     ;; this may be empty when called from superclass but should be called again in subclass
Calculate $cinst.RFL_ACTIVE as 1     ;; default new records to Active
Calculate $cinst.RFL_INHERIT as 0     ;; if ACTIVE is true, INHERIT must be false; they can both be false.
